## My process
### Built with

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned
I learned how to implement a lightbox gallery and how to use JavaScript to update the cart display.

javascript
function updateCartDisplay() {
  amtElement.textContent = amt;
  const total = (amt * 125.00).toLocaleString("en-US", { minimumFractionDigits: 2 });
  resultElement.textContent = $${total};
  if (amt > 0) {
    cartItems.style.display = "flex";
    checkoutButton.style.display = "block";
    emptyCartMessage.style.display = "none";
  } else {
    cartItems.style.display = "none";
    checkoutButton.style.display = "none";
    emptyCartMessage.style.display = "block";
  }
}
